# Rubik's Cube Solver

This project implements a solver for the 3×3 Rubik's Cube using clean object-oriented design and fundamental graph search algorithms such as:

- 🧠 Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- 🔍 Depth-First Search (DFS)
- ⏱️ Iterative Deepening DFS (IDDFS)

The cube is represented in three different formats:
- 🧱 3D Array
- 📦 1D Array
- 💡 Bitboard (bitwise representation for efficiency)

The codebase is modular, extensible, and designed to help understand both the Rubik’s Cube state space and search algorithms in action.

## 🔧 Features
- Clean OOP-based architecture
- Multiple cube state representations
- Solver comparison across algorithms
- Terminal-based interface
